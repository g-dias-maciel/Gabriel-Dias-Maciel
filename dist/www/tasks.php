        <h4>There is a folder with multiple JSON files that are in the same JSON format.

        <h4>You have a sorted array (ASC) given which can contain up to 1 million integer numbers.

         if not present return -1. Elements of the array are not unique, you can return the first one if multiple.

        <h4>Your task is to build a small application for bookkeeping (library) including books and users.
         The functionality needed is: get all books, get all users, and purchase (book, user). 
         You are free to use any storage like files, DB, or memory.
          We donâ€™t need a frontend for this you can just create a rest API or simple console output, 
          the focus is on the architecture.</h4>
